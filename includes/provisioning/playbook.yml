# Drupal LAMP Playbook (using task and handler includes) for Ubuntu 12.04
#
# This extremely simple Ansible playbook sets up a minimalistic Drupal
# environment for local testing. It is built for Ubuntu 12.04, and is structured
# using simple playbook task and handler include files. It uses most Ansible
# best practices, but as far as organization goes, this playbook doesn't use
# roles, groups, etc., and is intended as an example only.
