# Digital Ocean Example for Ansible

Chapter 7 of [Ansible for DevOps](http://ansiblefordevops.com/) contains details and examples for using Ansible to provision and dynamically work with Digital Ocean droplets.

## Dynamic Inventory and Provisioning

Examples using Ansible's Digital Ocean integration are contained within this directory.

  - `provision.yml` contains an example of provisioning a new Digital Ocean droplet, then immediately configuring it with Ansible.
  - `digital_ocean.py` is the Digital Ocean dynamic inventory script included with Ansible. Don't use this copy; get a fresh, up-to-date copy from the Ansible project instead.

Before you can use either of these examples, you will need to set a couple environment variables:

  - `DO_CLIENT_ID` (your Digital Ocean v1 API client ID).
  - `DO_API_KEY` (your Digital Ocean v1 API key).

These examples were created in 2015 by [Jeff Geerling](http://www.jeffgeerling.com/), author of [Ansible for DevOps](http://ansiblefordevops.com/).
