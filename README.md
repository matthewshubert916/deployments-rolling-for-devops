# Ansible for DevOps Examples

This repository contains Ansible examples developed to support different sections of [Ansible for DevOps](http://ansiblefordevops.com/), a book on [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) by [Jeff Geerling](http://jeffgeerling.com/).

Most of the examples are full-fledged VM examples, which use Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ansible to boot and configure VMs on your local workstation. Not all playbooks follow all of Ansible's best practices, since they are intentionally explicit and oriented towards illustrating particular Ansible features.

For even more interesting examples of what you can do with Ansible, please see my [Ansible Vagrant Examples](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-vagrant-examples) repository elsewhere.
